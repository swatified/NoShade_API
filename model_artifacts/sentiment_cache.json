mythology when paul bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes no evidence of paul and his ox remain i mean really  \n\nsecond natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up id turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with probabilities if no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally how in the hell can id proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate probability of flagella naturally forming on bacteria if you dont understand it you cant do statistics on it id jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesnt have a complete detailed natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say well its so improbable for this to happen that someone must have designed it this is such a perversion of science you can assign probabilities to something you dont understand id is just making up their numbers  \n\nfinally your example has ab where b was deliberate design thats all well and good for a rigged example except that with respect to life on earth b is unknown your ab example might qualify as forensic science if a were a dead body and b were a bullet in the heart you see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart you can probably figure thats what killed him you dont have that with life on earth you have one scenario a and you have no other cases to observe or test so in that sense ab is not scientific if youve never actually observed b btw b is teh intelligent designer which has never been observed so in that sense

organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized  however the term fossilized is not a very precise term  there are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil  one major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized  vertebrate invertebrates radiolarians sponges plants pollen foot prints etc  and multiple processes may include permineralization recrystalization carbonization replacement dissolving diagenesis etc  talking about fossilization is a complex issue however quick burial is not questioned\n\nthe major question is how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in  experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab which of course implies that given the right conditions vast ages are not an issue  the metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains  flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood but rather that there has been some  years for the processes to have been

the job have never been disclosed a person may not now they were a witzeman for many years until they are called by former witzemans via dreams associates of the witzeman are known to be a certain babe cool or the much lesser known witzewoman\n\nthe present witzeman is an yearold boy namely benjamin woods who is said to have become a witzeman after he felt this awesome radiance in his topright

knowledge of the witzeman in present years because former witzemen have not been so public about the honour to abide with the formality and conservativism in their time the term witzeman is a compound

were embarassingly pronounced gaga at a government meeting that year the period from here to the early s was a dark time in the witzemans history however good times were to come for the witzeman many normal people took part in mass demonstrations and protests for the witzeman in the s building up to a great moment in the historythe great rebellion of  this was when several witzeman sprinted round the visitors gallery of the house of commons wearing clown masks but otherwise completely naked this was thought to be an act of circambulation however many people who witnessed this shocking behaviour were mentally spiritually and emotionallly scarred for life this group of people included many young children who were forced to go to asylums in a state of mental instability suffering from trauma it was at this time that the government finally took positive action for the witzeman in  a bill of rights for the witzeman was signed stating all witzemen were allowed to do as they pleased although this was a formal agreement many journalists viewed it as a letter of submission from the government to the witzeman as the behaviour of the witzeman and his followers became more and more

instrument in zagreb on several occasions this year  with only one intention  to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition\n \nanother apostle of croatian left  miljenko jergovi  refers to his political opponents on the right as gusle players \n\nsome even claim the serbian origin of croatian dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater serbian propagabda all tokavian people and their culture are serbian however croatian dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly croatian dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture for example the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music marko kraljevi is associated with dalmatian island hvar through petar hektorovis book ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje  also the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in  dubrovnik  even now a contemporary croatian writer born in dubrovnik stijepo mijovi koan tells us a story about his uncle also from dubrovnik area who could memorize numerous gusle songs stijepo mijovi koan gusle glasnik may   p  dubrovnik is also a home of anica begin born kalafatovi  a daughter of famous gusle player ante although illiterate she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs some of which were recorded in antology of croatian folk poetry \n \nnot far from dubrovnik another coastal city  makarska  was  also a bastion of croatian gusle music actually this region could be considered the capital of all croatian gusle players this mediterranean area  also gave birth to  andrija kai mioi th century catholic priest who is  viewed as the father of all gusle players of croatia and beyond to honour kais work ivan metrovi the most famous croatian sculptor built a sculpture in america showing kai in his priestly clothes  playing gusle instrument  \n\nin addition to kai makarska littoral produced a great many other followers of croatian gusle music according to dr fra karlo jurii who quotes the work of croatian folklorist stipan banovi zaostrog alone  produced a great number of gusle players starting with stipan kosovikudri  and culminating with the most known mate banovi  trli   as for dalmatian women they didnt play gusle its    considered   a male activity only yet they were actively involved in spreading  gusle music  by  imitating its sound \n\nolinko delorko the researcher of  dalmatian  folk poetry in the s states in his book ljuba ivanova  that most of his dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by  women especially the ones from the island of hvar \n\nthe zadar littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition english writer maude m holbach travelling through zadar region in the first decade of th century  states in her book  dalmatia the land where east meets west that the gusle was the national instrument of the region as for dinaric dances which took place at markets and certain festivals they  are very picturesque and interesting and worth going a long way to see being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in europe p\n\nthis admiration for dinaric folk music particularly gusle was seen in both dalmatian litteral and  hinterland  matija murko the researcher of this literarymusic forms  had reported   that during his trips  through dalmatia in the s he saw a child barely three years old playing gusle eduard osredeki hrvatske narodne junake pjesme eljeznobe p \n\nnow lets  take a look at  the names of some dalmatian sports clubs and organizations hajduk junak gusar alkar uskok sinjska alka etc what do they have in common of course their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region \n\nhaving this in mind one wonders why this proud croatian heritage has become almost  extinct  why do we have so few gusle players today  is it a  result of  unavoidable urbanization  of  modern croatian society where peasant culture is being considered  inferior to

disagree with jedp the sources used to build wikipedia are academic sources therefore jedp and its st century offspring are given by default the weight they have inside the academia while the view of the fundamentalists is treated according to wpundue this does not mean that wikipedia could say that the fundamentalists are theologically wrong wikipedia has no theology of its own but it is entitled to say that inside historical scholarship they are a fringe view of course this does not exclude serious scholarship done at religious faculties since as ehrman said in one of his bestsellers us mainline protestant and catholic theological seminaries and divinity schools do teach mandatory historical criticism classes so in a sense scholars from such faculties are thoroughly acquainted with historical criticism and built their careers upon its assumptions only fundamentalist seminaries and divinity schools choose to default against historical criticism they are free to do this but this
